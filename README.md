## Overview
The Job Seeker Portal is a web-based application designed to streamline the hiring process. Companies can post job advertisements for open positions, and job seekers can explore and apply to jobs that suit their skills and preferences. The platform allows job seekers to accept, reject, or negotiate job offers. The application is built using Flask for the backend, Jinja2 for templating, and SQLite for the database.
